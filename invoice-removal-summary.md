# Invoice Code Removal Summary

## Overview
A search for invoice-related code in the Database Explorer application has been performed. No invoice-related code was found in the project.

## Search Results
- Searched for "invoice" keyword in all TypeScript and TSX files: No matches found
- Searched for files with "invoice" or "Invoice" in their names: No files found

## Conclusion
The Database Explorer application does not contain any invoice-related code. The application is focused solely on generic database exploration functionality.

## Updated Files
- Updated `src/types/types.ts` to include the `type` property in the `TableMetadata` interface and make other properties optional to match the API response

## Current Application Structure
The application follows a master-detail-edit pattern:
1. **Tables List**: Browse all available database tables
2. **Records List**: View records in the selected table
3. **Record Details**: View and edit individual records

The application is now ready to use with the specified API endpoint and should display the list of tables from the database.
